    "- A differential equation is an equation with one or more derivatives of a function. In sensor fusion, differential equations (in continuous time) or difference equations (in discrete time) can be used to describe the evolution of the states of a dynamic process between samples. Differential equations can also be used to derive state-space models that turn an Lth order differential (or difference) equation into a Ô¨Årst order vector-valued differential (or difference) equation."

In other words, state-space model is a first-order vector-valued differential equation converted from an Lth order differential equation.\n",
